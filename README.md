# PWMBasys3
PWM designed for the Basys3 having and output frequency of 200Khz to 500Hkz for Senior Design

Tested Frequencies are 100Mhz, 500Khz, 400Khz, 200Khz, and 100Khz. The PWM clock is parameterized in such a way that these frequencies can be input into the code
and the output of the PWM module will be the input frequency.

To Do Functionality :
1. Attach Basys3 xdc constraints file
2. Replace the testbench clock with the Basys3 100Mhz clock
